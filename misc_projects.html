    <p>
      For my master's project, I am developing a fuel model system designed for urban wildfires. Existing models are built around
      wildland environments and do not adequately represent the diverse and complex fuels present in cities and the WUI. My goal is
      to fill this gap by creating a model that better characterizes urban fire behavior.
      <br><br>
      An urban fuel model could be used to predict standard metrics such as rate of spread, fireline intensity, and flame length in a given geographic area.
      This information could be used to help communities assess their fire risk by informing where to prioritize fire breaks or controlled burns.
      <br><br>Timeline: Project to be completed before 2026.

    <h3>Project Plan</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Build a fuel model lookup system, extending the work of Scott & Burgan 2005.
      <ul>
        <li>Fuel categories include: fuel load by category (live vs. dead fuels), particle size class, surface-area-to-volume (SAV) ratio, heat content, fuel bed depth, and dead fuel moisture of extinction</li>
        <li>
          Wildland fuel model examples from Scott & Burgan 2005:<br>

    <p>
      The Eaton Fire occurred in January 2025 near Altadena, California. The fire destroyed over 9,000 structures, while others in close proximity to the flames
      remained intact. Our goal for this project was to build a model that predicts whether a structure burned in the 2025 Eaton
      Fire based on proximity to nearby burned structures and proximity to vegetation. This project was inspired by the study of Knapp et al. (2021), which analyzed housing arrangement and structure loss in the 2018 Camp Fire.

    <h3>Proximity to Vegetation</h3>
    <p><b>Step 1</b>:NDVI Derivation</p>
    NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is an effective way to distinguish vegetation from its background. It works by comparing how much near-infrared light and red light are reflected.<br>
    <img src="images/masters/ndvi_derivation.png" alt="ndvi" width="50%">
    <img src="images/masters/NDVI legend continuous.png" alt="NDVI legend continuous" width="5%">
    <br>
    <p><b>Step 2</b>:Calculate the distance between each structure and an NDVI between 0.3 and 0.8.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An NDVI between 0.3 and 0.8 tends to represent brush and trees.</li>
        <li>The following animation demonstrates the cells captured in the NDVI range of 0.3 to 0.8.<br>

        </li>
        
      </ul>
    <br>
    Example for calculating the distance between a structure polygon and a NDVI cell with a value 0.3-0.8:
    <br>
    <img src="images/masters/ndvi_distance - 2.png" alt="ndvi distance calculation" width="25%"><br>
    <ul>
      <li>We calculated both the minimum distance for each polygon, and the average distance for all points on the polygon.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Distribution of mean distance between structure and an NDVI between 0.3 and 0.8:</p>

    </a><br><br>
    This project provided an initial look at potential factors related to the 2025 Eaton Fire.
    Future work could expand the analysis by trying different models, incorporating additional distance thresholds, or examining building materials and wind patterns. Additionally, perhaps the same process could be run for a different wildfire. 
    <h1 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Mappy</h1>
    <p>
      Fall 2020-May 2021, I worked at the <i>Formal Analysis of Interactive Media (FAIM) Lab</i> at Pomona College.
      I assisted in the development of <i>Mappy</i>, a Rust program which interprets pixel data from emulated Nintendo
      NES games. Mappy's main feature is to produce game maps (linking together different levels and rooms), I specifically
      worked on Sprite Blobbing and Avatar Detection features, which involve tracking game sprites and grouping/classifying them
      based on their movement and relation to user input. In fall 2021, we submitted a paper on Mappy to a small conference called AIIDE
      (AI and Interactive Digital Entertainment). Not only was the paper accepted, but it also received an award for best paper at
      the conference.

    <p>
        Triumvirate Arena is a battle card game featuring three players: Nate, Chloe, and Grace. Each player type has three
        signature moves which might increase or decrease your health/mana, and/or do damage to the other player. The goal of
        this two player game is to reduce the opponent to zero health. This project was part of the spring 2022 Game Engine Programming class at Pomona College. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We wrote Triumvirate Arena in Rust, completely from scratch, without a pre-made game engine (using Bitblt and Vulkan shaders). In our team of 3 (myself, Chloe,
        and Grace), I worked on gameflow mechanics (health/mana interactions, turn taking); player moves; and creating original music,
        while my partners worked on other mechanics.

  <p>
      JumpyBall is a 3D parkour game. The player navigates through levels by jumping across platforms, avoiding the ground,
      and working their way to the end gem.
  </p><p>
      We used the Frender game engine (created by Professor Joseph Osborn), which assisted with the 3D rendering. We created
      the physics, collision system and assets from scratch.
  </p><p>
      In JumpyBall, I primarily worked on asset creation and the collision system. I created all of the 3D models in Blender 
      and wrote a Python script to create a set of bounding boxes for objects on the map (used for collision system). This project
      was also part of the spring 2022 Game Engine Programming class at Pomona College.
